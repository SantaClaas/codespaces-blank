# StuVe Cologne Web Page Mockup
## About
This is an experiment to create a web page for StuVe (student council/association) at Macromedia University of Applied Sciences in Cologne

## Goals
* Be a point of contact for students at Macromedia Cologne
* Inform students about events and news around StuVe
* Be familiar for people coming from the Macromedia context by following Macromedia Corporate Identity 
* but also be distinguishable from Macromedia because StuVe is first and foremost accountable to students and not the Macromedia Organization
